## üöÄ Overview

This project presents an **AI-powered mobile application** designed to enhance **e-waste management** through computer vision and intelligent decision-making.  
Users can capture an image of an unused electronic device, and the system ‚Äî powered by **Faster R-CNN with ResNet-101** ‚Äî classifies the item and provides actionable recommendations: **recycle, repair, repurpose, donate, or sell**.

The project demonstrates how **AI and automation** can drive sustainability by integrating **perception, reasoning, and cloud-edge computing** into a real-world decision support system. It promotes a **circular economy** by extending product lifecycles, reducing waste, and connecting users with local recycling and repair centers.
